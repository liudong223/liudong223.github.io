I'm currently a fourth year PhD student in Learning, Design and Technology program, Department of Curriculum and Instruction, College of Education, Purdue University. I am particularly interested in examining student activities within online or blended learning environments. My research aims to implement diverse instructional strategies and methods to enhance both the learning experience and student engagement. A key focus of my work is the utilization of visualization techniques, notably network analysis, to explore students interaction patterns in online discussions from both personal and group levels, thereby gaining insights into student social and cognitive development. Addtionally, I also have several projects related to AI in Education.
